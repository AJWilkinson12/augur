## Sprint 3 Additions

Added graph functionality to help users visually represent commits for a repository.

We also added routes for repo groups and specific repos. Default landing page `http://localhost:4200/` is a list of repo groups. Click on a group's link to go to a list of the repos in that group. Click on a specific repo's link to go to the page for that repo, where the graph will be seen.
